# Physics Debug Plan

## 1. Initial Setup and Verification
- [ ] Verify physics module is properly imported in main.js
- [ ] Add debug logging to track physics values in real-time
- [ ] Create a simple visual indicator for current throttle value
- [ ] Add position and velocity display to the overlay

## 2. Physics Parameter Tuning
- [ ] Adjust gravity constant (currently 9.81)
  - [ ] Try lower values (e.g., 5.0) for more manageable movement
  - [ ] Consider making it configurable
- [ ] Tune throttle acceleration (currently 0.1)
  - [ ] Test different values for better control feel
  - [ ] Consider making it proportional to throttle input
- [ ] Add minimum throttle threshold for takeoff
- [ ] Add maximum velocity limits

## 3. Movement Improvements
- [ ] Add air resistance/drag
  - [ ] Implement velocity-based drag
  - [ ] Make drag proportional to velocity squared
- [ ] Add momentum/inertia
  - [ ] Implement gradual throttle response
  - [ ] Add momentum when changing directions
- [ ] Add ground collision
  - [ ] Prevent falling below ground level
  - [ ] Add bounce or landing behavior

## 4. Control Refinements
- [ ] Implement exponential throttle curve
  - [ ] More precise control at low throttle
  - [ ] More power at high throttle
- [ ] Add auto-leveling behavior
  - [ ] Gradual return to level when no input
  - [ ] Configurable auto-level strength
- [ ] Add deadzone to throttle input
  - [ ] Prevent accidental movement
  - [ ] Make hovering easier

## 5. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Add integration tests
  - [ ] Test physics with actual game loop
  - [ ] Verify frame rate independence
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
  - [ ] Track physics update time
  - [ ] Monitor frame drops
- [ ] Add visual debugging tools
  - [ ] Show velocity vectors
  - [ ] Display force indicators

## 6. Polish and Fine-tuning
- [ ] Add smooth transitions
  - [ ] Gradual throttle changes
  - [ ] Smooth velocity changes
- [ ] Implement advanced features
  - [ ] Add wind effects
  - [ ] Add turbulence
- [ ] Optimize performance
  - [ ] Profile physics calculations
  - [ ] Optimize update frequency

## Implementation Order
1. Start with Initial Setup to verify basic functionality
2. Move to Physics Parameter Tuning for core feel
3. Implement Movement Improvements for realism
4. Add Control Refinements for better usability
5. Complete Testing and Validation
6. Polish and optimize

## Success Criteria
- Drone should feel responsive but not twitchy
- Movement should be smooth and predictable
- Controls should be intuitive and match FPV drone expectations
- Physics should be frame-rate independent
- Performance should be stable at 60fps

## Notes
- Keep changes small and testable
- Document all parameter changes
- Test with different frame rates
- Consider adding configuration options for easy tuning
